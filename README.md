# TODO

- Explain the project directories I have setup. For example, how I used the project reference feature in Typescript. What each folder means and what they consist of?
- Any specific coding styles or implementations others need to be aware of? e.g. how I used callbacks and wrappers in the express app.
- How to start and get each app running. (Be aware of all the configurations files such as .env in each project and the amplify setup in the frontend)
